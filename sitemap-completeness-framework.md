# Sitemap Completeness Assessment Framework

## Overview

This framework defines criteria for assessing the completeness of technical documentation sitemaps. A complete sitemap should include ALL available functions, classes, methods, examples, and API references within a technology's documentation domain.

## Completeness Criteria

### 1. API References (40% weight)

- **Functions/Methods**: All public functions, methods, and procedures
- **Classes/Interfaces**: All classes, interfaces, types, and structs
- **Modules/Packages**: All modules, packages, and namespaces
- **Constants/Enums**: All constants, enums, and configuration values
- **Properties/Attributes**: All properties, attributes, and fields

### 2. Core Documentation (25% weight)

- **Getting Started**: Installation, setup, and quick start guides
- **Core Concepts**: Fundamental concepts and architecture
- **Guides**: Step-by-step implementation guides
- **Best Practices**: Recommended patterns and practices
- **Configuration**: All configuration options and settings

### 3. Examples & Tutorials (20% weight)

- **Code Examples**: All code samples and snippets
- **Tutorials**: Complete tutorial series
- **Use Cases**: Real-world implementation examples
- **Recipes**: Common implementation patterns
- **Demos**: Interactive examples and demos

### 4. Advanced Features (10% weight)

- **Advanced Patterns**: Complex usage patterns
- **Performance**: Optimization and performance guides
- **Security**: Security considerations and implementations
- **Integration**: Third-party integrations and extensions
- **Migration**: Version migration guides

### 5. Reference Materials (5% weight)

- **Changelog**: Version history and changes
- **FAQ**: Frequently asked questions
- **Troubleshooting**: Common issues and solutions
- **Glossary**: Technical terms and definitions
- **Community**: Community resources and support

## Scoring System

### Completeness Levels

- **Complete (95-100%)**: All major documentation sections covered, minimal gaps
- **Near Complete (85-94%)**: Most documentation covered, minor gaps in advanced features
- **Moderate (70-84%)**: Core documentation present, missing some examples/advanced features
- **Incomplete (50-69%)**: Basic documentation only, missing significant sections
- **Critical Gaps (<50%)**: Major documentation sections missing

### Assessment Process

1. **URL Count Analysis**: Count total URLs in sitemap
2. **Section Coverage**: Identify which documentation sections are covered
3. **API Coverage**: Check for comprehensive API reference coverage
4. **Example Coverage**: Verify examples and tutorials are included
5. **Advanced Features**: Check for advanced patterns and features
6. **Reference Materials**: Verify supporting documentation is included

## Quality Standards

### URL Quality

- All URLs must be valid and accessible
- URLs should point to actual documentation pages
- No broken or placeholder links
- Consistent URL structure and naming

### XML Structure

- Valid XML sitemap format
- Proper XML declaration and encoding
- Consistent URL entry format
- No duplicate entries

### Content Organization

- Logical grouping of related documentation
- Clear hierarchy and structure
- Comprehensive coverage without redundancy
- Easy navigation and discovery

## Technology-Specific Considerations

### Programming Languages

- Standard library documentation
- Language features and syntax
- Built-in functions and operators
- Language-specific patterns

### Frameworks & Libraries

- All public APIs and methods
- Framework-specific patterns
- Integration guides
- Plugin/extension documentation

### Databases

- All SQL commands and functions
- Data types and schemas
- Administration and configuration
- Performance and optimization

### Infrastructure Tools

- All commands and options
- Configuration files and settings
- Deployment and scaling guides
- Monitoring and troubleshooting

## Assessment Checklist

For each sitemap, verify:

- [ ] All major API functions/classes included
- [ ] Getting started and setup guides present
- [ ] Code examples and tutorials included
- [ ] Advanced features documented
- [ ] Configuration options covered
- [ ] Migration and changelog information
- [ ] FAQ and troubleshooting sections
- [ ] All URLs are valid and accessible
- [ ] No duplicate entries
- [ ] Proper XML formatting
- [ ] Logical organization and structure

## Reporting Format

For each sitemap assessment:

- **Technology**: Name of the technology
- **Current URL Count**: Number of URLs in existing sitemap
- **Completeness Score**: Percentage (0-100%)
- **Missing Sections**: List of missing documentation areas
- **Priority Level**: Critical/High/Medium/Low for enhancement
- **Recommendations**: Specific actions needed for improvement
